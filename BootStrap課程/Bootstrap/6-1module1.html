                <p>Coffee is one of the world’s most popular beverages. Some claim it is the most widely consumed liquid
                    in the world aside from water.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <img src="./img/coffee/coffee2.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Coffee is more than a beverage, however. It is a memory, an anticipation, a lifetime of consoling
                    moments of modest pleasure woven into our lives.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <img src="./img/coffee/coffee3.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Coffee’s success as a beverage undoubtedly is owing both to the caffeine it harbors and to its
                    sensory pleasure. Coffee lovers come to associate the energizing lift of the caffeine with the
                    richness and aroma of the beverage that delivers it.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <img src="./img/coffee/coffee4.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Coffee is produced from the seeds of a small red (sometimes yellow) fruit that grows on plants
                    halfway in size between shrub and tree. The process that turns these seeds into beverage is a long
                    and complex process, perhaps the most complex process associated with any major beverage.。</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <img src="./img/coffee/coffee5.jpg" alt="">
                <p>It is also a very labor intensive process involving a vast intercontinental collaboration that starts
                    with the coffee grower, moves from there to the picker, then to the mill workers who meticulously
                    remove the fruit and dry the beans, then to those who clean and grade the beans, to those who roast
                    them, to those consumers and baristas who finally grind the beans and prepare the beverage. </p>

                <img src="./img/coffee/coffee6.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Every act along the way can be performed either with passion and precision or with careless
                    shoddiness. It is the cumulative quality of all of these creative contributions that together make
                    the difference between a lackluster cup and a fine and distinctive one.</p>

                <p>Coffee Review is devoted to promoting the fine, distinctive cup and celebrating its lore and
                    pleasures.</p>

                <img src="./img/coffee/coffee8.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Delicately sweet, high-toned, citrusy. Key lime, cocoa nib, strawberry, freesia-like flowers, cedar
                    in aroma and cup. Sweetly tart structure with juicy, vibrant acidity; lush, creamy mouthfeel. The
                    finish consolidates to sweet fruit notes (berries and citrus) and cocoa nib.</p>
